- 👋 Hi, I’m @CopperCableIsolator
- 👀 I’m interested in learing about the inner workings of the machines and algorithems, that set the foundations of our very lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Python as well as some basic logic. I am also very keen on learing about AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on uhhhhm anything not too hard. I know the basics, but might need some helping hand every now and then.
- 📫 How to reach me: I am reachable via my email.
